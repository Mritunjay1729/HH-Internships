I am out of words to explain the undisputed customer support from Saurabh Sir, he has been a constant support throughout. He has been there for every query, time and again and addressed them quite well. I can say this with no reservations that Saurabh Sir has set the perfect example of how the Customer Support should be. It wouldn't be wrong to say that he is one of the major reasons for me choosing ISEL Global for my certification. 

I can also firmly quote that the confidence I have today in Green Belt is all owed to my trainer, Ayesha Mam. She has done a tremendous job in clearing all the concepts starting from the very basics. She has also provided effective project support. At this point, I feel that I am ready to take up any projects, assessments on Green Belt level. I Thank her for the forming the concrete foundation of my concepts.

The training program is by far the most balanced certification program I have come across. With a perfect blend of Conceptual learning and industrial based examples used for explaining the concepts, this program had the perfect curriculum. Adding to it, is the project that was provided, which was absolutely aligned with the concepts and tools being brought to implication. Having said this, it wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for the resources provided by the institute, right from the eBooks, Hard copies, Tool kits, case studies and the lecture recordings, all of these go a long way in establishing the satisfaction that I have in this course and intent to strongly recommend.

1447,Google Reviews,I have completed my green belt from ISEL Global. The classes were good. The instructor was good. She taught all the subjects nicely and handled all the queries well.One feedback would be to provide a good book/manual. The manual provided is a printout of the presentation and doesn't clearly explain the topics.Only 3 stars because I dint liked how the management handles it's buiseness. There was no transparency at all. I completed my six Sigma test by 4th week of May and it took 2 months for me to recieve the certificate ( I was told I will get this is in 15 days after completion of course). I have to call several times and everytime I was told that the certificate was dispatched and I will be getting this within 2-3 days which was never the case. I understand there is lack of system in place to handle all this activity. I request ISEL to be transparent while handling such things. Providing false information/ claims would only lead to loss of reputation.,12-07-2020

1455,Google Reviews,"I would fondly appreciate the program and highly recommend my colleagues and friends to take the Six Sigma Certification only from ISEL Global.I am short of words to explain the undisputed customer support from Saurabh Sir, he has been a constant support throughout. He has been there for every query, time and again and addressed them quite well. I can say this with no reservations that Saurabh Sir has set the perfect example of how the Customer Support should be. It wouldn't be wrong to say that he is one of the major reasons for me choosing ISEL Global for my certification.I can also firmly quote that the confidence I have today in Green Belt and Black Belt is all owed to my trainers, Ayesha Mam and Deepak Sir. They have done a tremendous job in clearing all the concepts starting from the very basics. They have also provided effective project support. I Thank them for the forming the concrete foundation of my concepts.The training program is by far the most balanced certification program I have come across. With a perfect blend of Conceptual learning and industrial based examples used for explaining the concepts, this program had the perfect curriculum. Adding to it, is the project that was provided, which was absolutely aligned with the concepts and tools being brought to implication. Having said this, it wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for the resources provided by the institute, right from the eBooks, Hard copies, Tool kits, case studies and the lecture recordings, all of these go a long way in establishing the satisfaction that I have in this course and intent to strongly recommend.",12-07-2019
